# Welcome to the Free and Open Source Software Club at UW-Madison ðŸ‘‹

At the Free and Open Source Software Club, we aim to create a friendly environment for members of all knowledge and skill levels to explore the world of free and open source technology and software. Whether you're a computer science/engineering major and want to find a community to develop software with, or you just want to learn more about free and open source software and how to use it, you've come to the right place.
